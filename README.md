Link-Shortener
Implementation of link shortening using basic javascript APIs Used Window.location.search to access the query part of the URL. 
Used URLSearchParams to work with the query string, always initialize it with new as it is a builtin javascript class or constructor.
Used simple const mapper to store key value pairs for different query values
